## 1. Introduction

AI systems, particularly those involved in text summarization, can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify existing biases. This project explores a simplified approach to detect and analyze such biases, focusing on gender, race, and other demographic factors.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Text Summarization

A frequency-based summarization technique is used:

1.  Tokenization
2.  Preprocessing
3.  Frequency Calculation
4.  Sentence Scoring
5.  Summary Generation

### 2.2 Bias and Demographic Analysis

Keyword matching is used to identify potential biases and analyze demographic representation.  `bias_keywords` and `demographic_groups` are defined to target specific biases and demographic groups.

### 2.3 Sentiment Analysis

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is used to analyze the sentiment of sentences containing bias or demographic keywords.

## 3. Usage

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/bias-and-demographic-analysis.git` (Replace with your repository URL)
2.  Install the required libraries: `pip install nltk`
3.  Download NLTK data (run this *once*):
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt_tab')
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
    ```
4.  Run the script: `python main.py`

## 4. Example Output

(Paste a representative example of the output here, as shown in the previous responses.  Keep it concise but illustrative.)

## 5. Limitations

*   Keyword matching doesn't consider context.
*   Keyword selection is crucial.
*   Simplified approach; more sophisticated methods are needed.

## 6. Future Work

*   Named Entity Recognition and Coreference Resolution
*   Machine learning models for bias detection
*   Advanced contextual analysis
*   Explainable AI (XAI)
*   Larger datasets
